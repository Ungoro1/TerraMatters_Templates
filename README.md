# 🌀 Product Circularity Datasheet (PCDS)

Welcome to the **Product Circularity Datasheet (PCDS)** repository. This project provides a framework and tooling to define, generate, and validate circularity information for products in both human-readable and machine-readable formats.

## 🌱 What is a PCDS?

A **Product Circularity Datasheet** is a standardized document that communicates the circularity characteristics of a product. It enables better decision-making for reuse, recycling, and remanufacturing, supporting the transition to a circular economy.
